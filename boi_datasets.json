The inflation expectations calculation is as follows: For each bank, and for each day, an average of interest rates on deposits and on credit is calculated for each term and for each indexation basis. Afterwards, the expectations are computed for each bank and for each day as a ratio of the unindexed interest rate to the CPI-indexed interest rate. Using the daily expectations for each bank, a daily average of all the banks is calculated, and then an average for the month is computed.","932":"The figure for a particular month is calculated as the average of the forecasters projections for inflation (change in the Consumer Price Index) in that month, issued during the 30 days prior to the date of publication for the CPI for that month.

For instance, for January 31, 2016 (meaning the CPI for January 2016), the figure reflects the average of projections issued between January 16, 2016 and February 15, 2016. The projections are the simple average of inflation projections by commercial banks and economic consultants that provide the Bank of Israel with their projections in an orderly fashion.
